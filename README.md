#### Thoughts about AI
<br>I learn really fast. New tech or edge computing? Count me in. <br>
I'm much faster at completing finished software than AI. <br>
Cool compliment, but, kinda disappointing, AI should be smarter. <br>
Sure it can code a simple code snippet fast, give insturctions. Like a shopify store. Nothing that can scale to billions of users. <br>
Can it do what I do? Like design, invent, patent and build an automated AI complex system, do the documentation, than code it. No. <br>
I tested it. AI can't an engineer at my level. Not even close. I tried. <br><br>

My point, I make my client's wealthy. Very wealthy. Hiring me, is a good idea. <br>
