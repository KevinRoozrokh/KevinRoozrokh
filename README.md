#### Some Thought about AI:
<br>I learn really fast. New tech or edge computing? Count me in. <br>
I'm much faster at completing finished software than AI. <br>
Cool compliment, but, kinda disappointing, AI should be smarter. <br>
Sure it can code a simple code snippet fast, give insturctions. Design, invent and build a complex systen, do the documentation, than code it, setup hybrid cloud server, host the website or app, change DNS to private, ptoect IP from cyber attacks with CloudFlare than create me automated AI Agents to automate tedious things faster than me? Not even close.
I tested it. AI can't be me. Not even close. I tried. <br>
