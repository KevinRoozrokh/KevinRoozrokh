My name is `Kevin Roozrokh`.<br>
Welcome to my Github. Open to remote principal and senior level software engineering contract work. <br> Check out my skill set below. <br>I learn really fast, so if it is new or edge computing tech, count me in. <br>
I'm much faster at completing finished software than AI. I tested it. AI can't be me. Not even close. I tried. <br>
