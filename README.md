#### About Me:
I learn stupid fast. New tech, framework or edge computing? Count me in. <br>
I'm much faster at completing finished software than AI. <br>
I tested it. AI can't out code an engineer at my level. Not even close. I tried. <br>
I am really, really good at `inventing, designing, writing, researching and submitting patents`. <br>
So much better than a patent attorney, I can have any patent from idea to USPTO pending in less than 24 hours. <br><br>
Besides tech, I love animals, classical music, cars & Formula 1 Racing. <br> 
Favorite video game? The stock market.
