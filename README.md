#### Coding 

AI, Crypto, Blockchain, or edge computing? Count me in. <br><br>
I have trained 100s of GPTs, MCPs and AI Agents to do all my work with me or for me, depending on the requirements.<br>
Vibe coding ninja, my personal record? Completing 3 applications in one day.<br>
Although AI can code faster than any human, I make significantly less mistakes when completing, and deploying finished software. <br>
I tested it. I make less mistakes too. <br><br>
Also, I am ridiculously good at writing `patents.` <br>

#### ¬ÆÔ∏èPatents

Patents Written = 24 <br>
üí°Patents Pending = 11 <br>
